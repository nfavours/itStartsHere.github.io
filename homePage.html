	<h1>It Starts Here</h1>

	<p><strong>It Starts Here</strong> was started in 2016 by the External Affairs Team of Brookdale Hospital Medical Center.  The genesis of the program brought approximately 45 children from surrounding schools to visit Brookdale Hospital.  Through tours to the morgue, lecturing, visual examples from our trauma department, the personal stories from guest speakers, students were educated aboout the long-term and short-term effecs of gun violence on the victim, the community and more.  The follow-up, will empower students to create campaigns within their schools and communities, encouraging an in-depth assessmemt of the social health of the community, and the issues plaguing our youth</p>
